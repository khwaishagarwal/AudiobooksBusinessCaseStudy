# AudiobooksBusinessCaseStudy
The task is to create a model, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again from an Audiobook app. We  have a .csv file summarising the data. We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. So, we are predicting if: based on the last 2 years of activity, a customer will convert in the next 6 months.
